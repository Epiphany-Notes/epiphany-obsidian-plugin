# Epiphany Voice Plugin

Send transcribed voice notes to Obsidian from your iPhone and Apple Watch in seconds.

This plugin makes it ridiculously easy to dictate notes to Obsidian without ever needing to open the Obsidian mobile app.

The Epiphany Voice mobile app will need to be installed to function. 

[iOS App Store Page](http://www.epiphanyvoice.io) (ios only currently)

## Installation Instructions

1. Install and create an account in the Epiphany Voice mobile app

2. In Obsidian, install and enable the Epiphany community plugin.

3. Enabling will open a new One Time Password tab. (Use the same email your Epiphany account is associated with). Enter the One Time Password you receive via email to complete the authentication process.

## Usage
- Once the OTP process is complete in Obsidian, you'll be able to create an action with Obsidian in the Epiphany app.

Options for Note creation:
- By default, notes will go to an "Epiphany Notes" note. 
- If you toggle "Create a separate note for each record", a new note will be created for every new Epiphany you send.
- (Daily note appending coming soon)


## Voice Note Synchronization

#### Periodic Fetching
The plugin will periodically check for new voice notes on the Epiphany service and update your vault. You can also manually trigger a sync via the command palette.
